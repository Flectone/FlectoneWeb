# AdvancedBan

Integration with `AdvancedBan` checks if a player is muted and prevents them from sending messages, as well as disables moderation commands in `FlectonePulse`

::: warning WARNING  
It's better to manually disable these commands in `command.yml`, as they may not always be disabled automatically
