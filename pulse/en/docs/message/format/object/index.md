### `player_head`

Enables formatting of the `<player_head>` placeholder. It can be used in different ways
- `<player_head>` returns the head of the player who wrote the message
- `<player_head:Notch>` returns the head of the player whose nickname was written inside
- `<player_head:Notch:false>` returns the head of the player with the second layer disabled, whose nickname was written inside
- If the specified nickname doesn't exist, the head will have a random default skin

::: tip NOTE

The `<player_head>` is already built into the `playerlistname` module by default and it only works for players who have the unofficial game. For licensed versions, the tab will be normal

### `sprite`

Enables formatting of the `<sprite:...>` placeholder. It can be used in different ways
- `<sprite:name>`, returns an icon from the `blocks` atlas, for example `<sprite:item/diamond_sword>` (this is the same as `<sprite:blocks:item/diamond_sword>`)
- `<sprite:atlas:name>`, returns an icon from the specified atlas, for example `<sprite:gui:container/slot>`
- If the sprite is specified incorrectly, it will be an unknown texture. Using a resource pack you can create your own sprites

The easiest way to find atlas and icon names is in the folder created using the `F3 + S` combination inside Minecraft. There will be `minecraft_textures_atlas_...` files with `.txt` and `.png` format, using this it's easy to find the right sprite.

::: info EXAMPLE

There is a `gui` atlas with the name `minecraft_textures_atlas_gui.png.txt`. In it you can find a line with `minecraft:container/slot	x=494	y=54	w=18	h=18`

Using these coordinates you can visually find it in the `.png` atlas (to see what it looks like). To display it inside Minecraft, you need to remove the `minecraft:` prefix

As a result, we get `<sprite:gui:container/slot>`
