# Metrics

Collection of anonymous server information

::: tip INFO

`FlectonePulse` does not collect your players' nicknames, does not collect your server's IP, does not collect any personal information about the server. Your server cannot be identified by this information, you have nothing to worry about. All information that is collected can be viewed in the [server analytics](/metrics/)

:::

[//]: # (config.yml)
<!--@include: @/parts/words.md#setting-->
<!--@include: @/parts/words.md#path--> `config.yml â†’ metrics`

<!--@include: @/parts/words.md#default-->
<<< @/files/config.yml#metrics
