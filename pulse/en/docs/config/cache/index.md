### `types`

List of all caches used in `FlectonePulse`

| Type                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DIALOG_CLICK`         | For tracking the number of clicks in custom dialogs, such as in `/chatsetting`. This allows closing the dialog for people who click in them too often, i.e., spamming                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `OFFLINE_PLAYERS`      | For storing offline players who have left the server but might return. Also stores names that could be players, for example `/tell Notch`. Obviously, `Notch` is not on the server, but to search for such a player `FlectonePulse` uses a series of operations and finally queries the database. If found, it is saved with that data; otherwise, it is stored as an unknown player. Subsequent `/tell Notch` commands will fetch it directly from the cache, bypassing all checks |
| `MODERATION`           | For storing moderation results about players. Most often used to avoid querying the database every time a player joins the server                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `LEGACY_COLOR_MESSAGE` | For storing the results of formatting strings containing legacy formatting, e.g., why replace `&c` with `<red>` every time if it can be taken from the cache. This is necessary because a custom message is formatted for each player, and these messages are often the same                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `MENTION_MESSAGE`      | For storing the formatting results of messages for the `mention` module. This is necessary because a custom message is formatted for each player, and these messages are often the same                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `SWEAR_MESSAGE`        | For storing the formatting results of messages for the `swear` module. This is necessary because a custom message is formatted for each player, and these messages are often the same                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `REPLACEMENT_MESSAGE`  | For storing the formatting results of messages for the `replacement` module. This is necessary because a custom message is formatted for each player, and these messages are often the same                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `REPLACEMENT_IMAGE`    | For storing formatted images for the `replacement` module                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `TRANSLATE_MESSAGE`    | For storing messages that need to be translated                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `PROFILE_PROPERTY`     | For storing player profiles with their skins, to avoid querying `SkinsRestorer` each time and creating them manually                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
