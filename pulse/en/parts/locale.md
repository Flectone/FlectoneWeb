You can create and use your own localizations. To do this:
1. Copy one of the [files](/docs/localizations/)
2. Rename it, preferably as in the [game](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Language)
3. Now you can modify any messages inside this file

::: tip Example
I want to translate the plugin into Belarusian
1. I copy the file `ru_ru.yml`
2. Rename it to `be_by.yml`
   ![locale](/locale.png)
3. Done!
