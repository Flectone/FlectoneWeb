### `null_player`

Message shown if the player entered via `custom_command` is not found

### `format_reply`

The message format for the `<reply>` tag when a message is a reply to another one

### `custom_command`

A list of custom integration commands, where the key is the command name and the value is its message format

<Callout type="info" title="Example">

    ```yaml
    custom_command:
    tps:
    content: "<tps>"
    ```

    A command to get the `tps` value on the server. **Don't forget to define it in integration.yml**

</Callout>

### `Placeholders`

You can use all the placeholders that are used in the initial Minecraft message.
<Callout type="info" title="Example for a ban message">
    There is a `<reason>` placeholder there, which means I can use `<reason>` inside Twitch messages.
</Callout>

There are also placeholders that are GUARANTEED to be replaced in any message:
- `<final_message>` the message sent to Minecraft
    - `<final_clear_message>` the message sent to Minecraft without unicode emojis
        - `<player>` the nickname of the player who sent the message
            - `<message>` the raw message written by the player
                - `<plain_message>` the formatted message written by the player
                    - `<reply>` the formatted reply message; it will be empty if the main message is not a reply
                        - Obviously, all placeholders from `PlaceholderAPI` and `FlectonePulse` will also work

                        <br/>
                        A message sent from Twitch to Minecraft has its own placeholders:

                        | Placeholder    | What it returns                                            |
                        |----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
                        | `<name>`       | Twitch user's nickname                                    |

                            ### `message_channel`

                            A list of messages with the final message format

                            <Callout type="info" title="If you want to add another message:">
                                1. Take the name from the `message types` list
                                2. Insert it into `message_channel`
                                ```yaml

                                There can be any number of channels, as long as the connected account has access to them. Localization configuration is optional; by default, the message will be sent with the `<final_message>` format.
