### `null_player`

Message shown if the player entered via `custom_command` is not found

### `format_reply`

The message format for the `<reply>` tag when a message is a reply to another one

### `custom_command`

A list of custom integration commands, where the key is the command name and the value is its message format

<Callout type="info" title="Example">

```yaml
custom_command:
  tps:
    content: "<tps>"
```

A command to get the `tps` value on the server. **Don't forget to define it in integration.yml**

</Callout>

#### `Placeholders`

You can use all the placeholders that are used in the initial Minecraft message.
<Callout type="info" title="Example for a ban message">
There is a `<reason>` placeholder there, which means I can use `<reason>` inside Telegram messages.
</Callout>

There are also placeholders that are GUARANTEED to be replaced in any message:
- `<final_message>` the message sent to Minecraft
- `<final_clear_message>` the message sent to Minecraft without unicode emojis
- `<player>` the nickname of the player who sent the message
- `<message>` the raw message written by the player
- `<plain_message>` the formatted message written by the player
- `<reply>` the formatted reply message; it will be empty if the main message is not a reply
- Obviously, all placeholders from `PlaceholderAPI` and `FlectonePulse` will also work

A message sent from Telegram to Minecraft has its own placeholders:

| Placeholder    | What it returns                                            |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `<name>`       | Telegram username handle                                  |
| `<user_name>`  | Telegram username handle                                  |
| `<first_name>` | Telegram user's first name                                |
| `<last_name>`  | Telegram user's last name                                 |
| `<chat>`       | Telegram chat title (where the message originated)        |

### `custom_command`

A list of custom integration commands; the key is the command name and can be anything. Commands can ONLY be informational; they do not and will not execute anything on the server.

| Parameter     | Explanation                                                                    |

    aliases:
      - "!tps"
      - "!tickpersecond"
```

A command to get the `tps` value on the server using `!tps` or `!tickpersecond`. **Don't forget to create the message in the localization file**

</Callout>

### `channel_info`

Configuration for information channels

#### `enable`

Whether the information channel is required

<include>../../../parts/ticker.en.mdx</include>

### `message_channel`

A list of message types and Telegram chat IDs

<Callout type="info" title="For example, I want Minecraft `/ban` command messages to be sent to Telegram">
1. Copy the chat ID where the message should be sent (`-1002341720267_49`)

If the bot is connected and added to the channel, you can use the `/id` command in Telegram to find out the channel ID.

2. Configure it:
```yaml
message_channel:
  COMMAND_BAN:
    - "-1002341720267_49"
```

There can be any number of chats, as long as the bot has access to them from [secrets](/pulse/docs/secrets/telegram/). Localization configuration is optional; by default, the message will be sent with the `<final_message>` format.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn" title="Important">
If your channel is a Forum (Topic), the **MAIN** channel ID must be specified without the `_` suffix.

1. My main channel ID (which always ends in `_1`) is `-1002341720267_1`
2. Therefore, you should enter **ONLY** `-1002341720267`

This rule does not apply to other chats within the forum, where the **FULL** ID must be entered.
