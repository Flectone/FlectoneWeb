<Callout type="warn" title="Warning">

    Full support for `InteractiveChat` does not and will not exist; if achievements, deaths, etc., are not displayed, this is an issue with `InteractiveChat` and its modification of all packets. This can be fixed by disabling some functions in the `InteractiveChat` config itself.

    With `InteractiveChat` enabled, the message deletion module will not work or messages will be duplicated.

</Callout>

My personal advice as the author of `FlectonePulse`: do not use `InteractiveChat` on your server until its author decides to write it properly. It simply creates a delay for chat messages, which is very noticeable.
