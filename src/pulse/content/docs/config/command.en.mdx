### `unregister_on_reload`

<Callout type="warn" title="Warning">
    It is not recommended to enable this on older Minecraft versions; otherwise, there may be errors/warnings in the server console, though they do not affect the plugin's operation.
</Callout>

If enabled, `FlectonePulse` will remove and re-add its own commands during `/flectonepulse reload`. This can cause drops in `tps` and `mspt` due to a large number of packets, so it is better to disable this setting if you encounter such an issue.


If disabled, you will need to restart the server to correctly disable a command from `FlectonePulse` (in `commands.yml`).

### `disabled_fabric`

A list of commands **not** from `FlectonePulse` that should be disabled when the `Fabric` server starts. This provides the opportunity to replace already occupied commands on `Fabric`, such as `/me` or `/ban`.
