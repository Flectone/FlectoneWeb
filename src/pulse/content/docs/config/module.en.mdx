### `enable`

Enables or disables the operation of all modules.

1. Every module has a parent (the one located above it).

<Callout type="info" title="Example">
    ```yaml
    house:
    door:
    chair:
    ```

    `house` is the parent of `door` and `chair`.
</Callout>

2. Every module depends on the parent's `enable` status.

<Callout type="info" title="Example">
    ```yaml
    house:
    enable: false
    door:
    enable: true
    chair:
    enable: true
    ```

    `house` is disabled, which means regardless of whether `door` and `chair` are enabled, they will also be disabled.
</Callout>

### `use_paper_message_sender`

If enabled, `FlectonePulse` will use `Paper` as a tool for sending messages to a player's chat.

How does it work? First, the plugin creates a message internally and obtains `FlectonePulse.Component`; this object is converted into a standard `String`. Then, `Paper` itself is used to derive a `Paper.Component` from this string and send it to the player.

<Callout type="warn" title="Warning">

    For this to work, `PacketEvents` must be installed on the server as a separate plugin, and the server core must be `Paper` or its fork.

</Callout>
