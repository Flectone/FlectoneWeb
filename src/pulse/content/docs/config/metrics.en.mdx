<Callout type="info" title="Information">

    `FlectonePulse` does not collect your players' nicknames, does not collect your server's IP, and does not collect anything personal about the server. Your server cannot be identified by this information; you have nothing to worry about. All information that is collected can be viewed in the [server analytics](/pulse/metrics/).
