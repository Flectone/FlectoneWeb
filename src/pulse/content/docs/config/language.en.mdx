### `type`

Localization used for all plugin messages

<Callout type="warn" title="Warning">
    The selected localization must be from the `localizations` folder
</Callout>

You can create and use your own localizations by following these steps:
<Steps>
    <Step>
        Copy one localization file, for example `ru_ru.yml`
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Rename it, preferably according to the [game's standards](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Language)
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Now you can modify any messages within this file
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info" title="Example">
    I want to translate the plugin into Belarusian
    1. Copy the file `ru_ru.yml`
    2. Rename it to `be_by.yml`
    ![locale](/pulse/locale.png)
    3. Done!
</Callout>

### `by_player`

If enabled, the Minecraft localization of each player will be checked, and a [message](/pulse/docs/message) will be displayed accordingly

<Callout type="info" title="Information">

    If you change messages with `by_player` enabled, remember to do so in ALL localization files

</Callout>

![locale](/pulse/locale.gif)

If such a localization does not exist, the localization from `type` will be used
