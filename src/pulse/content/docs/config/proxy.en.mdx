### `clusters`

A list of clusters to which the server should be connected. Used only when proxy mode is enabled.
If the list is empty, the server receives all messages from other servers.

<Callout type="info" title="How to use?">
    You need to enter the cluster name on all servers where messages will be received and sent.
    ```yaml
    clusters:
    - "test_cluster"
    ```

    This way, servers are linked together and messages will only be exchanged between these servers.
</Callout>

### `bungeecord`

Enables communication with `BungeeCord`.

<Callout type="idea" title="How to configure this?">
    1. The `FlectonePulse-bukkit.jar` file must be placed in the `plugins` folder on `BungeeCord`. Even if you have a Fabric server, you must place `FlectonePulse-bukkit.jar` on `BungeeCord`.
    2. On all servers where communication with `BungeeCord` is required, `bungeecord: true` must be enabled in FlectonePulse.
    3. The selected database must be `MySQL`, `MariaDB`, or `PostgreSQL` (i.e., server-based).
</Callout>

### `velocity`

Enables communication with `Velocity`.

<Callout type="idea" title="How to configure this?">
    1. The `FlectonePulse-bukkit.jar` file must be placed in the `plugins` folder on `Velocity`. Even if you have a Fabric server, you must place `FlectonePulse-bukkit.jar` on `Velocity`.
    2. On all servers where communication with `Velocity` is required, `velocity: true` must be enabled in FlectonePulse.
    3. The selected database must be `MySQL`, `MariaDB`, or `PostgreSQL` (i.e., server-based).
</Callout>

### `redis`

Used for communication between different servers. For `user` and `password`, you can use environment variables, such as `${VALUE}`.


#### `enable`

Enables `Redis` operation.

#### `host`

The host (IP) of the server where `Redis` is running.


#### `port`

The port of the server where `Redis` is running.

#### `ssl`

Enables the use of `SSL`.

#### `user`

The username in `Redis`; if none, it can be left empty.

#### `password`

The user password in `Redis`; if none, it can be left empty.
