<Callout type="info" title="Information">

    You can skip colors using `null` so they aren't replaced. For example, `/chatcolor see null null <red> <red>` will only replace `<fcolor:3>` and `<fcolor:4>`, leaving the first two unchanged.

    If you have the `other` permission, you can change the colors of other players by adding their nickname at the end of the command, for example `/chatcolor see null <red> <red> <blue> TheFaser`. You must specify all color slots before the nickname, but you can skip them as described above.
