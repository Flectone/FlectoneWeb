![command emit](/pulse/commandemit.png)

The command is available by default only to server admins and is created specifically for them.
It should not be given to regular players.
This command can be used through the console, another plugin, or a datapack, which is convenient if you want to use tools from FlectonePulse (any placeholders and tags will also work).

To display text to all players at once, you can use `all`, for example `/emit all CHAT hello world`.
Some `destination` types have arguments that can be modified via `{}`.
These arguments are named exactly as they are in the configuration files.

Examples
- `/emit TheFaser ACTION_BAR{times={stay=40}} hello world`
- `/emit TheFaser BOSS_BAR{color=RED} hello world`
- `/emit TheFaser BRAND hello world`
- `/emit TheFaser CHAT hello world`
- `/emit TheFaser TITLE hello world`
- `/emit TheFaser SUBTITLE hello world`
- `/emit TheFaser TAB_FOOTER hello world`
- `/emit TheFaser TAB_HEADER hello world`
- `/emit TheFaser TEXT_SCREEN{offset_x=-0.3, offset_y=-0.2} hello world`
- `/emit TheFaser TOAST{icon="minecraft:iron_ingot", style=CHALLENGE} hello world`

Arguments that are omitted will use default values and do not all need to be entered. If the `destination` is entered incorrectly, the message will be sent to the regular chat.
