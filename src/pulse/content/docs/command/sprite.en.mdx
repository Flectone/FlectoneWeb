### `categories`

List of categories, i.e., available atlases

<Callout type="info" title="Information">
    - Each atlas is downloaded only once if it does not exist in the `FlectonePulse/minecraft/<version>/atlases/` folder
    - Each atlas has the final format `minecraft_textures_atlas_<atlas>.png.txt`
        - Each atlas is downloaded from Flectone's own web server via the link `https://flectone.net/files/r/minecraft/<version>/atlases/minecraft_textures_atlas_<atlas>.png.txt`
            - Atlases do not necessarily have to be downloaded from the web server; you can place them in the `FlectonePulse/minecraft/<version>/atlases/` folder in advance yourself by obtaining them using the `F3 + S` combination in Minecraft
