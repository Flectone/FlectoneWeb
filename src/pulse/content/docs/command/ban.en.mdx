### `null_player`

Message if the entered player is not found

### `null_time`

Message if an impossible time is entered

### `lower_weight_group`

Message if the command is executed by a player with a lower group weight than the player being moderated

### `reasons`

A list with keys and values, where the key is a word and the value is a specific reason

<Callout type="info" title="You can add your own reasons, for example">
    ```yaml
    random_kek: "Random reason"
    ```
    Then if I type `/ban player 1d random_kek`, the reason will be `Random reason`

<include>../../../parts/suggestOfflinePlayers.en.mdx</include>

### `show_connection_attempts`

If enabled, it will show a message that a banned player attempted to connect
![command ban connect](/pulse/commandbanconnect.png)

### `check_group_weight`

Whether player groups will be checked. If the player being moderated has a higher role than the command sender, the command will not execute and the `lower_weight_group` error will occur

<include>../../../parts/range.en.mdx</include>

### `time_limits`

Time limits depending on the sender's group. The key is the group weight, and the value is the maximum moderation time in milliseconds (`1` second = `1000` milliseconds)

<Callout type="info" title="Example">
    ```yaml
    time_limits:
      20: 35000
      50: 100000
    ```

    - If a player has a group weight of `10`, the command will NOT be executed
    - If a player has a group weight of `20`, the maximum amount of time will be `35000`
    - If a player has a group weight of `40`, the maximum amount of time will also be `35000`
    - If a player has a group weight of `50` or higher, it will be `100000`

    For unlimited time, use the value `-1`
</Callout>
