### `suffix`

Format of the suffix that will be displayed if the player has an active mute; otherwise, it will be empty

### `reasons`

A list with keys and values, where the key is a word and the value is a specific reason

<Callout type="info" title="YOU CAN ADD YOUR OWN REASONS">
    ```yaml
    random_kek: "Random reason"
    ```
    Then if I type `/mute player 1d random_kek`, the reason will be `Random reason`

<include>../../../parts/enable.en.mdx</include>

<include>../../../parts/suggestOfflinePlayers.en.mdx</include>

### `check_group_weight`

Whether player groups will be checked. If the player being moderated has a higher role than the command sender, the command will not execute and a `lower_weight_group` error will occur

<include>../../../parts/range.en.mdx</include>

### `time_limits`

Time limits depending on the sender's group. The key is the group weight, and the value is the maximum moderation time in milliseconds (`1` second = `1000` milliseconds)

<Callout type="info" title="Example">

    ```yaml
    time_limits:
      20: 35000
      50: 100000
    ```

    - If a player has a group weight of `10`, the command will NOT be executed
    - If a player has a group weight of `20`, the maximum time will be `35000`
    - If a player has a group weight of `40`, the maximum time will also be `35000`
    - If a player has a group weight of `50` and above, it will be `100000`

    For unlimited time, use the value `-1`

</Callout>
