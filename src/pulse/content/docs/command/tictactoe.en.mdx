By default, a request is sent for [Chinese tic-tac-toe](#rules-of-chinese-tic-tac-toe); if you want to play the standard version, use `/tictactoe nick false`
![command tictactoe default](/pulse/commandtictactoedefault.png)

### Rules of Chinese tic-tac-toe

1. Each player can only place `3` of their marks.
2. If the game hasn't ended, the first mark placed by the player is removed and a new one is placed.
3. This continues in a cycle until the game is over.

As a result, the game becomes complex and strategic!
