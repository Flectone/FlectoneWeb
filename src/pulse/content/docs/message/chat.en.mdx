<Callout type="info" title="How to disable local chat?">
    Inside `message.yml` disable `local` using `enable: false`, and also set an empty `trigger: ""` for `global`

    ```yaml
    chat:
      enable: true
      mode: "BUKKIT"
      priority: "NORMAL"
      types:
        local:
          enable: false # set false
        global:
          enable: true
          cancel: false
          range: "PROXY"
          priority: 5
          trigger: "" # remove trigger
          null_receiver:
            enable: true
            destination:
              type: "ACTION_BAR"
              times:
                stay: 20
          destination:
            type: "CHAT"
          cooldown:
            enable: false
          sound:
            enable: false
    ```

### `mode`

Chat processing mode

| Type      | Explanation                                                                              |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PACKET`  | Chat messages are processed via packets (fully asynchronous)                             |
| `BUKKIT`  | Chat messages are processed via `Bukkit` (asynchronous, but only in one chat thread)     |
| `PAPER`   | Chat messages are processed via `Paper` (asynchronous, but only in one chat thread)      |

<Callout type="warn" title="Warning">
    If you need another plugin to see chat messages, set `mode: "BUKKIT"`. In rare cases, if the plugin works through `Paper` listeners, you should set `mode: "PAPER"`
</Callout>

### `priority`

Priority of the chat message event. Change this value if there is a conflict with other plugins using the chat.

| Type      | Explanation                                                                     |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `LOWEST`  | The chat message will be processed before all other plugins                     |
| `LOW`     | The chat message will be processed after plugins with `LOWEST` priority         |
| `NORMAL`  | The chat message will be processed after plugins with `LOW` priority            |
| `HIGH`    | The chat message will be processed after plugins with `NORMAL` priority         |
| `HIGHEST` | The chat message will be processed after plugins with `HIGH` priority           |
| `MONITOR` | The chat message will only be observed                                          |

### `types`

List of all chats with their settings. Any default chat looks like this, and you can add your own:

```yaml
chat_name:
  enable: true
  cancel: true
  range: PROXY
  priority: number
  trigger: "trigger"
  null_receiver:
    enable: true
    destination:
      type: "ACTION_BAR"
      times:
        stay: 20
  destination:
    type: "CHAT"
  cooldown:
    enable: false
  sound:
    enable: false
```

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="Setting">
        #### `enable`

        Enables functionality

        #### `cancel`

        - If `true`, the chat message event is canceled for other plugins
        - If you need another chat-related plugin (like DiscordSRV) to work, set to `false` (this may cause console duplication)
        ![chat console](/pulse/chatconsole.png)

        <include>../../../parts/range.mdx</include>

        #### `priority`

        Chat priority used to determine which chat is selected when multiple chats have the same `trigger`. The chat with the higher priority is chosen

        <Callout type="info" title="For example, if there are chats:">
            ```yaml
            admin:
              priority: 20
              trigger: "!"
            helper:
              priority: 10
              trigger: "!"
            ```

            If a player has permission for both chats, the `admin` chat will be selected by the plugin because it has a higher `priority`
        </Callout>

        #### `trigger`

        The message prefix that must be used to send a message to this chat

        <Callout type="info" title="The `trigger` value can be anything:">
            - `!`, `admin`, `.f`, etc.
            - empty, i.e., `trigger: ""`, then any message matches this chat
        </Callout>

        The `trigger` is removed from the final message, meaning if a player sends `!hello`, the result will be `hello` without `!`

        #### `null_receiver`

        Enables the "No one heard you" message if no one heard the player
