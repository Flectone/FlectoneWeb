</Tabs>

### `default_symbol`

The symbol for standard `<player_head>` and `<sprite>` tags if the recipient cannot see the resulting object (for `<player_head_or>` and `<sprite_or>`, this is specified manually).

### `player_head`

Enables formatting for the `<player_head>` placeholder. It can be used in several ways:
- `<player_head>` returns the head of the player who sent the message.
- `<player_head:Notch>` returns the head of the player whose nickname is specified inside.
- `<player_head:Notch:false>` returns the head of the specified player with the second layer disabled.
- If the specified nickname does not exist, the head will have a random default skin.
- `<player_head_or:...>` returns the player's head or the text specified as the first argument if the recipient cannot see heads in chat. For example, `<player_head_or:hello:Notch>` returns Notch's head, but the word `hello` will appear in the console.

<Callout type="idea" title="Note">
    The `playerlistname` module already has `<player_head>` built-in by default, and it only works for players using unofficial game versions. For licensed versions, the tab list remains standard.
</Callout>

### `sprite`

Enables formatting for the `<sprite:...>` placeholder. It can be used in several ways:
- `<sprite:name>` returns an icon from the `blocks` atlas, e.g., `<sprite:block/oak_log>` (equivalent to `<sprite:blocks:block/oak_log>`).
- `<sprite:atlas:name>` returns an icon from the specified atlas, e.g., `<sprite:gui:container/slot>`.
- If the sprite is specified incorrectly, it will appear as an unknown texture. You can create your own sprites using a resource pack.
- `<sprite_or:...>` returns the icon or the text specified as the first argument if the recipient cannot see icons in chat. For example, `<sprite_or:hello:block/oak_log>` returns the oak log icon, but the word `hello` will appear in the console.

The easiest way to find atlas and icon names is by using the [/sprite command](/pulse/docs/command/sprite/).

You can also find these in the folder created using the `F3 + S` combination in Minecraft. There will be `minecraft_textures_atlas_...` files in `.txt` and `.png` formats, which can help you find the appropriate sprite.

<Callout type="info" title="Example">
    There is a `gui` atlas named `minecraft_textures_atlas_gui.png.txt`. Inside, you can find a line like `minecraft:container/slot  x=494  y=54   w=18   h=18`.

    Using these coordinates, you can visually locate it in the `.png` atlas. To display it inside Minecraft, remove the `minecraft:` prefix.

    The result is `<sprite:gui:container/slot>`.

### `need_extra_space`

Enables adding an extra space for `<player_head>` and `<sprite>` instances written in config files. Space is not added to player messages.
