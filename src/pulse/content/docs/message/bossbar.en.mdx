### `announce`

List of messages when entering a specific boss bar, where the key is the boss bar name (e.g., `entity.minecraft.ender_dragon`)

### `types`

List of messages for vanilla boss bars. The key `event.minecraft.raid.raiders_remaining` is special; it is automatically added to raid messages if necessary.

### `announce`

Can be used to notify the player that they have entered the "dragon" zone (or any other). This does not affect the main boss bar but only complements the functionality. It will trigger every time the player enters the boss bar zone.

The key is the boss bar name (e.g., `entity.minecraft.ender_dragon`), and the value is where the notification will be sent.

<Callout type="info" title="EXAMPLE">
    I want a chat message saying "It's a dragon!" to appear when a player enters the dragon's boss bar zone.
    ```yaml
    announce:
    entity.minecraft.ender_dragon:
    destination:
    type: "CHAT"
    sound:
    enable: false
    ```

    The message must also be added to the localization:

    ```yaml
    announce:
    entity.minecraft.ender_dragon: "It's a dragon!"
    ```
</Callout>
