<Callout type="info" title="How does `<fcolor:...>` work?">
    `<fcolor:...>` is a placeholder that is replaced by values from [`default_colors`](/pulse/docs/message/format/fcolor/en.mdx#default-colors) or, if the player has their own, by the player's custom colors.

    The value of `<fcolor:...>` can be anything, but the command only allows writing colors of any format and `<gradient:...:...>`. There can be any number of these values; the maximum count is determined by the highest digit in [`default_colors`](/pulse/docs/message/format/fcolor/en.mdx#default-colors).

        Each digit represents a specific color. By default: `<fcolor:1>` is used for the primary color, `<fcolor:2>` is used for the primary color with emphasis (e.g., a name), `<fcolor:3>` for local chat messages, and `<fcolor:4>` for global chat messages.

            `<fcolor:...>` has several states. By default, it is `see` — colors that the player will see for ALL messages ONLY for themselves, unless replaced by `out` — colors that ALL players will see for messages from THIS specific player (i.e., that player's personal colors).

                Confused? There is an explanation in the image below, or here is an example: A player enters the command `/chatcolor see red red red red`. This means the player sees all messages as red on their end, but other players see messages according to their own settings. Now, suppose the player enters `/chatcolor out green green green green`. This means all of this player's messages will appear green to them and to all other players as well. It's important to understand that `out` overrides colors from `see` if they exist, meaning the player will also see other messages as green.

                In simple terms: `see` is for personalizing YOUR OWN view, while `out` is for colors that OTHER players will also see.
